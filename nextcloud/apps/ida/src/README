Steps for setting up node.js for Vue UI development:

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
    source ~/.bashrc  (or copy appended NVM config from .bashrc to .zshrc and source .zshrc)
    nvm --version  (just to verify it's working)
    nvm install 20 --lts
    nvm alias default 20
    node --version  (should be 20.x.y)
    npm --version  (should be 10.x.y)

From within /var/ida/nextcloud/apps/ida:

    npm install
    npm install -S @nextcloud/dialogs
    npm install -S @nextcloud/files
    npm install -S vue-router@3
    npm install fs-extra path --save-dev

After every modification to Vue UI or changes/additions to translations:

    npm run dev  

Before MR:

    npm run build
