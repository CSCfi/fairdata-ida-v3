	    Fairdata IDA (ida.fairdata.fi) is a continuous service for safe research data storage,
		offered free of charge to Finnish universities, universities of applied sciences and
		state research institutes.

	<description>
	    This Nextcloud app is part of the Fairdata IDA research data storage service.

	    Fairdata IDA provides storage space for data that is described as a research dataset
		with the Fairdata Qvain tool. The described data can be set openly available for anyone
		to download or its availability can be restricted. The data owner decides on the openness
		and usage policies for their data. The research dataset published with Qvain gets a
		persistent identifier (DOI) and a landing page in Etsin. This makes the dataset findable
		for others, and enables re-use of the data and creating a scientific reference.

        The app provides functionality for selecting individual folders or files within the
        working space of a particular project and preparing them for preservation, making them
        available to other CSC Fairdata data preservation services by:

        * Rendering files immutable by moving them to a protected "frozen" project space
        * Generating PIDs for each file which can be used to include files in one or more data sets
        * Generating checksums for each file
        * Storing technical metadata about each file
        * Replicating all files to ensure data integrity
        * Providing secure access to trusted Fairdata services

        Fairdata IDA is organized by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture.
        The service is produced by CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd., Espoo Finland

        Proper access to files, and their associated metadata, is the responsibility of
        the each trusted CSC service which is provided access to the Fairdata IDA service.
